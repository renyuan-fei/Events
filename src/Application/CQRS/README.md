Sure, I can help you write some documentation for the code you've provided. Here's a brief overview:

# Application Documentation

## Overview

This application is a C# project that uses the MediatR library for implementing the CQRS pattern. It also uses Entity Framework Core for data access and AutoMapper for object-object mapping.

## Entities

The main entity in this application is `Activity`, which represents an activity that can be created, updated, deleted, and retrieved.

## Commands

The application uses commands to perform write operations. Each command is handled by a corresponding command handler. The commands include:

- `CreateActivityCommand`: Creates a new activity.
- `UpdateActivityCommand`: Updates an existing activity.
- `DeleteActivityCommand`: Deletes an existing activity.

Each command handler validates the command using FluentValidation, performs the operation, and then saves the changes to the database.

## Queries

The application uses queries to perform read operations. Each query is handled by a corresponding query handler. The queries include:

- `GetActivityByIdQuery`: Retrieves a single activity by its ID.
- `GetAllActivitiesQuery`: Retrieves all activities.
- `GetPaginatedListActivitiesQuery`: Retrieves a paginated list of activities.

Each query handler retrieves the data from the database, maps the entities to DTOs using AutoMapper, and then returns the results.

## Tests

The application includes unit tests for the command handlers. The tests are written using xUnit and Moq.

Please refer to the individual files for more detailed documentation on each class and method.
